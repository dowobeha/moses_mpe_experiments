# Decoder 1
Dynamic PT (created from result of decoder 0)
Static LM


# Goal
Capture the phrase table used by decoder 0 during decoding.
Use that phrase table as the dynamic PT for decoder 1.
Recreate the result of decoder 0 using decoder 1.
The created phrase table should have located (indexed) source words, 
   as per Marie & Max (2015)


# Status
Success

# Next step:
Take a set of ranges (corresponding to annotated correct target segments),
   and select which phrase table entries are consistent with those ranges.

Those will constitute a positive dynamic PT.
