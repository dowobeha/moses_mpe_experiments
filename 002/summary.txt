Calculate word alignments for dynamic PT

# Decoder 0

# Decoder 1
Dynamic PT (created from result of decoder 0)
Static LM


# Goal
Use a lexical PT to add alignment info into the generated dynamic PT

# Status
Success

# Next step:
Take a set of ranges (corresponding to annotated correct target segments),
   and select which phrase table entries are consistent with those ranges.

Those will constitute a positive dynamic PT.
